            As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the
            study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
            physics and chemistry The field applies laws of
            different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
            physics, relativity, particle physics, etc- This book
            unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics,
            which will be crucial for the holistic understanding
            of the subject matter

            Are we alone in the Universe? Was there anything
            before the Big Bang? Are there other tmiverses?
            What makes stars shine? Where does Earth's water
            come from? Why is the night sky dark? Was there
            ever life on Mars? How do telescopes work? This
            engaging guide book answers all these questions

         This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology
         is an exciting update of an award-winning
         textbook. It explains modem cosmological
         concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the
         Big Bang theory. Its clear, lucid writing style, with
         a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it
         exceptionally engaging.

         Planetary research today is a strongly
         multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming
         from engineering and natural sciences. This book
         provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience-
         focused overview of solid solar system bodies and
         their evolution, based on the comparative
         description of processes acting on them.

         In writing this textbook the authods objective was
         to provide students with a non-trivial, reasonably
         priced introduction to astronomy- Starting with
         problems astronomers face on Earth connected witb
         observation, the book then moves on to cover the
         Solar System, galaxies and finally cosmology-
